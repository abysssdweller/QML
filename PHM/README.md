Quantum Machine Learning for Bearing Prognostics

This repository contains two hybrid Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models developed for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction using the NASA IMS bearing dataset:

VQC Notebook – Variational Quantum Circuit regression model (8-qubit, angle encoding, 5-layer ansatz).

QLSTM Notebook – Hybrid LSTM architecture with integrated quantum layers for temporal feature enhancement.

Both models were developed using PennyLane + TensorFlow and evaluated against classical baselines as part of a Mitacs Globalink Research Internship at Toronto Metropolitan University.

Dataset: NASA IMS Bearing Dataset

Frameworks: PennyLane, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
