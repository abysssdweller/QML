# Quantum Reservoir Computing (Repeated Measurements) — PennyLane

Implementation of the QRC architecture from *“Quantum reservoir computing with repeated measurements on superconducting devices”* (arXiv:2310.06706), evaluated on **NARMA2 / NARMA5 / NARMA10** using a **linear readout**.

> Note: the notebook is currently configured with **1 unit** for fast runs.  
> To match the paper’s setup, set `n_units=6`.
